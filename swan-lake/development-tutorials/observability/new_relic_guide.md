intro: The sections below include information about how to observe Ballerina programs with New Relic.
---

Users can observe Ballerina programs with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), which is an observability platform designed to help organizations monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot their applications, infrastructure, and digital experiences in real time. Both metrics and tracing in Ballerina can be viewed with New Relic.

This [Example](<LINK_TO_OVERVIEW_OF_BALLERINA_OBSERVABILITY_PAGE_EXAMPLE_SECTION>) will be used in the guide. Follow the steps given below to observe Ballerina tracing and metrics in New Relic.

### Step 1 - Create New Relic Account and generate API key

Sign up and Generate an API Key in New Relic.

To configure the API key in Newrelic:
> Go to **Profile -> API keys -> Insights Insert key -> Insert keys** to create an account in New Relic.

### Step 2 - Import Ballerina New Relic extension

To include the New Relic extension into the executable, the `ballerinax/newrelic` module needs to be imported into your Ballerina project `main.bal` file.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/newrelic as _;
```

New Relic extension has a `Opentelemetry GRPC Span Exporter` which will push tracing data as batches to the New Relic server endpoint (https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317) in opentelemetry format.

New Relic extension pushes metrics in New Relic metric format to the New Relic server endpoint (https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1).

### Step 3 - Configure Ballerina runtime configurations

Tracing and metrics can be enabled in your Ballerina project using configuration similar to the following in your `Config.toml` file.

```toml
[ballerina.observe]
tracingEnabled=true
tracingProvider="newrelic"
metricsEnabled=true
metricsReporter="newrelic"

[ballerinax.newrelic]
apiKey="<NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY>"    
tracingSamplerType="const"          
tracingSamplerParam=1               
tracingReporterFlushInterval=15000  
tracingReporterBufferSize=10000     
metricReporterFlushInterval=15000   
metricReporterClientTimeout=10000
```

The table below provides the descriptions of each configuration option and possible values that can be assigned.

Configuration key | Description | Default value | Possible values 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
ballerinax.newrelic. apiKey | API key generated by user in the New Relic platform. **This configuration is mandatory.** | `None` | 
ballerinax.newrelic. tracingSamplerType | Type of the sampling methods used in the New Relic tracer. | const | `const`, `probabilistic`, or `ratelimiting`.
ballerinax.newrelic. tracingSamplerParam | It is a floating value. Based on the sampler type, the effect of the sampler param varies | 1.0 | For `const` `0` (no sampling) or `1` (sample all spans), for `probabilistic` `0.0` to `1.0`, for `ratelimiting` any positive integer (rate per second).
ballerinax.newrelic. tracingReporterFlushInterval | The New Relic tracing client will be sending the spans to the agent at this interval. | 15000 | Any positive integer value.
ballerinax.newrelic. tracingReporterBufferSize | Queue size of the New Relic tracing client. | 10000 | Any positive integer value.
ballerinax.newrelic. metricReporterFlushInterval | The New Relic client will be sending the metrics to the agent at this interval. | 15000 | Any positive integer value.
ballerinax.newrelic. metricReporterClientTimeout | Queue size of the New Relic metric client. | 10000 | Any positive integer value.

### Step 4 - Run the Ballerina service

When Ballerina observability is enabled, the Ballerina runtime collects tracing and metrics data and both metrics and traces will be published to New Relic.

Run the following command to start the Ballerina service.

```
$ bal run

Compiling source

Running executable

ballerina: started publishing traces to New Relic on https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317
ballerina: started publishing metrics to New Relic on https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1
```

### Step 5 - Send requests
 
Send requests to <http://localhost:8090/shop/products>.

Example cURL commands:

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/shop/products
```
```
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/shop/product \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "id": 4, 
    "name": "Laptop Charger", 
    "price": 50.00
}'
```
```
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/shop/order \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "productId": 1, 
    "quantity": 1
}'
```
```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/shop/order/1
```

### Step 6 - View metrics on New Relic platform

You can view the metrics that were published to the New Relic platform in the New Relic query builder. You can view the metrics query data in graphical format, as shown below.

![New Relic Metric Query Builder](/learn/images/newrelic-metric-query-builder.png "New Relic Metric Query Builder")

You can create a dashboard from the metrics provided by Ballerina in New Relic platform.

### Step 7 - View tracing on New Relic platform

You can view the traces that were published to the New Relic platform in New Relic traces.
